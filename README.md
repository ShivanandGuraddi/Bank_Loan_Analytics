# Bank Loan Analysis Project

Welcome to the Bank Loan Analysis Project repository! In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of loan data to assess credit risk and optimize lending strategies for a financial institution. Leveraging my expertise in SQL for data querying and manipulation, alongside Tableau for data visualization, I delved into the loan dataset to identify factors influencing credit risk and borrower behavior. By creating interactive Tableau dashboards, I visualized loan performance metrics, default rates, and borrower profiles, providing valuable insights to inform strategic decision-making. This project showcases my skills in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving within the banking domain, contributing to more informed lending practices and improved portfolio performance.
